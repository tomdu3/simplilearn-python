# scipy has a collection of mathematical algorithms and scientific functions built on the numpy  extension
# high level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data
#  multi dimensional image processing
# includes functions for computing integrals numerically solving differential equations, optimization, etc.

# application of scipy:
# 1. multi-dimensional image processing
# 2. solve differential equations and fourier transforms
# 3. optimization algorithms
# 4. linear algebra

from scipy import constants


print(constants.c)  # speed of light
print(constants.pi)  # pi
print(constants.e)  # e
print(constants.h)  # planck's constant
print(constants.N_A)  # Avogadro's number
